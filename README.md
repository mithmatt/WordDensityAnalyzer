1. Running the program:

Ensure that Java 1.7 or better is installed. Run the following command (Don't forget to include 'http://'):
java -jar Assignment.jar <website-URL>

Sample command:
java -jar Assignment.jar "http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/10/politics/edward-snowden-profile/"

Sample output:
Please be patient while the website is being parsed...

Rank	Relevance	Keywords
----	---------	--------
1		18.510		liberty
2		10.500		cnnpolitics com
3		9.020		safeguard privacy, to safeguard privacy
4		8.630		edward snowden
5		8.010		privacy liberty


- Higher the rank, the more relevant is the keyword
- Relevance is relative
- Comma separated list of keywords



2. Logic:

Through online research, it was found that the most important keywords of a website appear in the following (the main 4):
	- URL itself
	- title of the document
	- metadata description
	- headers of the html page

The keywords in the metadata were not considered in this program since it was inferred that this field in html was abused by people in the past, to boost page rankings. The abovementioned parts are used by developers to attract visitors who are interested in the content of the website. Hence, they contain relevant information.

Besides the above four fields, the whole document was also parsed to obtain keywords and strengthen the previously obtained keywords from the main 4.

N-Grams (default: 2-grams to 4-grams) are generated from the main 4 as well as the html document and the keywords are assigned weights, based on where they appear. The weights were decided after observation from test runs. The keyword phrases generated by the N-Gram Generator was weighed accordingly. Default weights for N-Grams are as follows:

	- URL							2.0
	- title of the document			3.5
	- metadata description			3.0
	- headers of the html page		1.0, 0.5, 0.25, ... (based on level of header)
	- document						0.01
